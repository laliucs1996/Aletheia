# Aletheia

A chat bot with a focus in the Twelve Olympian Gods including both Hestia and Dionysus, both being Olympians in different works, but never together. The goal is to convert it into a discord bot.

## How It Works

The bot responds to Who is a "insert name of god/goddess" or "insert name of god/goddess" + fact (example: hestiafact) and can give a basic description of itself when asked it's name or age among other things.

## Technologies

This bot is run on Python 3.6 and was built using NLTK, TensorFlow, Numpy and TFLearn.
<br />In order to run this bot please run the versions:

- Tensorflow 1.2
  - Tensorflow provides the chatbot with the slightly more intelligent ability to determine intent.
- NLTK 3.4.4
  - NTLK, Natural Language Toolkit, is used to trim and tokenize words to be understandable by the bot.
- Numpy 1.16.0
  - Numpy makes it easy for array management.
- TFLearn 0.3.2
  - Built on top of Tensorflow to make it easier to use.
